We expect you to implement tasks three and four of the assignment:\n- Implement a view to list and edit the currencies that you follow.\n- Implement a view to list current prices of the currencies that you follow.\n\nTo ease the development, there is a module already created and routed for you to write the solution.\n\nThe specific folder structure of this project can be found in its README, at `/services/front-end/README.md`. [See README](https://github.com/Planet-Dataset/fullstack-assignment/tree/feature/front-end-service/services/front-end#readme)\n\n## Overall recommendations\n1. The content of this landing page is written in Markdown. This, and the README at `/services/front-end/README.md` are good\nplace to put any comments on how you imeplemented the front-end solution.\n2. NgRX is installed and configured, including the library to use the development tools. You may use it to manage the app's state.\n3. it is not compulsory to translate the interface, but everything is already setup in case you want to provide a more\nwell-rounded app.\n4. A good place to start is the list to view and edit currency subscriptions. The back-end functionality is already provided\nto you.\n5. Important, we care about your time. If something is taking you a long time, it is probable not what we ask you to implement.\nWe only seek two list views, and controls for adding and removing subscriptions.\n\nGood luck!"
