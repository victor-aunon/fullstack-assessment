# Planet fullstack-assignment - Front-end project
Full-Stack position skill assessment home assignment.

## Context
As a Full-Stack developer in Planet Dataset, you will be asked to participate in the design
and implementation of new features that will be used in our price-management platform for
eCommerce.

New features are geared towards automations and, in our pletform, developing them usually
involves three different tasks:
1. Implementing an interface to configure the user's preferences.
2. Implementing API endpoints to retrieve data such as result examples.
3. Implementing asyncronous tasks that apply the changes to our clients' stores.

This is the workflow that we tried to replicate in this task. The theme is forex analysis,
and we will require you to implement an API call to retrieve currencies from the database,
an asynchronous task to retrieve the data from an external API, and the interface to subscribe
and list different currencies.

## Overview

This is a basic Angular 14 project that was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). It is provided
as a template in case you want a jumpstart. It already has a `forex` module with routing and localization in place so that you
can implement there the UI.

The following libraries are included in case you want to use it:
- [NgRX](https://ngrx.io/) for state management (optional).
- [Transloco](https://ngneat.github.io/transloco/) for localization (optional).
- [Material Angular](https://material.angular.io/) for UI components (optional).

## Project folder structure

- `src/app/common` - Folder with Angular modules for common functionality.

- `src/app/common/layout` - Angular module with the layout components

- `src/app/common/layout/components/main-layout` - The main layout component. It has the language toggle and basic navigation. Feel free to edit it.

- `src/app/features` - Folder with Angular modules for each feature. We understand that a feature is an independent bulk of functionality that has its own routing. 

- `src/app/features/forex` - Angular module for the forex feature. It is where we propose you to implement the solution

- `src/app/features/forex/i18n` - Translations for the forex module

- `src/app/features/forex/pages` - Folder with the forex page component

- `src/app/features/home` - Angular module for the landing page

- `src/app/features/home/i18n` - Translations for the home module

- `src/app/features/home/pages` - Folder with the landing page component

- `src/app/transloco` - Localization module

- `src/assets` - Static assets including, but not limited: styles, images, translations

- `src/environments` - Environment JSON files.

- `src/testing` - Utility classes and functions.

## Development
You can launch the front-end development server from within the root directory using Make (see the README), or you can
use the Angular CLI from within this folder:

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via Jest.
